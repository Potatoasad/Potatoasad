### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- âš¡ I'm a graduate student in Physics trying to advance methods for gravitational wave population analysis
- ðŸ”­ I also work on creating precision tests of theories beyond Einstein's theory of General Relativity, by looking at specific frequencies in the gravitational waves produced by black hole mergers. 
- ðŸ’» I'm a big fan of the Julia programming language, and end up doing most of my numerical work there. But I also tend to create packages with some sort of JAX backend.
